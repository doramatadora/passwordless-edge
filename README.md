# Passwordless authentication at the network's edge

This is a proof-of-concept implementation of passwordless authentication at the network's edge, using [Passkeys](#what-are-passkeys) & Fastly [Compute@Edge](https://www.fastly.com/products/edge-compute).

It uses [KV Store](https://www.fastly.com/blog/introducing-object-store-enabling-powerful-applications-at-the-edge) (a [CRDT-based edge state](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/architecture-global-scale/) system) to store user data, credentials and challenges.

## What are Passkeys? 

[Passkeys](https://passkeys.dev/) are a new type of login credential that allows you to log in to sites and services without having to enter a password – think biometric locks. 

Passkeys are a compelling [WebAuthn](https://webauthn.guide/#about-webauthn)-based alternative to the ubiquitous “password + 2nd-factor” authentication. Unlike low assurance 2nd factors like SMS, they're resistant to [push](https://blog.hypr.com/what-are-push-notification-attacks)-phishing, unique across every website, and are generated using cryptographically secure hardware.

Additionally, passkeys generated by the 3 main platform authenticator vendors (Apple, Google, and Microsoft) are automatically synced across a user's devices, by their cloud account.

## What is _this_?

Look at the far right side of this diagram:
![FIDO2: WebAuthn + CTAP diagram](https://fidoalliance.org/fido2-project/fido2-graphic-v2/)

Imagine building a high scale, globally distributed [FIDO2 authentication solution](https://fidoalliance.org/specifications/) — without having to manage the underlying infrastructure. The code is executed at the network's edge, close to your users.

## Try it yourself

> If you haven't got a Fastly account, get one [for free](https://www.fastly.com/signup/), and head on over to [developer.fastly.com](https://developer.fastly.com/learning/compute) for instructions on getting started with Compute@Edge.

> You'll need to install the [Fastly CLI](https://developer.fastly.com/learning/compute#install-the-fastly-cli) and [Rust language tooling](https://developer.fastly.com/learning/compute#install-language-tooling).

### 1. OpenSSL

You'll need OpenSSL to perform WebAuthn ceremonies, but WebAssembly isn't batteries-included. 

This repository includes OpenSSL precompiled for `wasm32-wasi` as a submodule. If you didn't clone it with the `--recursive` flag, use the following to pull the submodule:

```term
git submodule update --init --recursive --depth=1
```

Source `load-openssl.sh`. This exports two environment variables that configure how `openssl-sys` (the Rust system crate that handles the OpenSSL bindings) is built. The purpose of this script is to use the precompiled OpenSSL for wasm32-wasi library root, over your system's OpenSSL, and tp make sure OpenSSL is then statically linked:

```term
source ./load-openssl.sh
```

### 2. Run!

Run `fastly compute serve --watch` to spin up a local development server and see the demo in action, or `fastly compute serve --watch` if you want to hot-reload any changes to the code.

Open `http://localhost:7676/` in your browser, rather than `http://127.0.0.1:7676` – `127.0.0.1` is not a valid WebAuthn [Relying Party](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#webauthn-relying-party) domain.
